                <h2>What is this?</h2>
                <p>This is a fun self-project to visualize people's resolutions for 2026. Each colorful marble in the jar represents a real resolution from someone who shared their hopes and dreams for the new year.</p>

                <h2>Times Square, New Year's 2026</h2>
                <p>These resolutions were collected in Times Square during New Year's week, where I asked people from around the world what they wanted to achieve in 2026. Having lived in NYC, it's wonderful to see how many people visit globally and spend their New Year's week here. The energy, diversity, and optimism of the crowd is something truly special.</p>
